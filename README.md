# Mass-conserving-life-cycles
Code and data for the paper "The possible modes of microbial reproduction are fundamentally restricted by distribution of mass between parent and offspring"

# Unicellular organisms

Contains the code and data for reproduction modes of rod-shaped and spherical cells. 

## Optimal life cycle calculation
The code there is intended to run on a cluster managed by slurm (see run.sh). 

## Data and data analysis
Contains the resulting data files and the code producing a figure.

# Rosette colonies

Contains the code and data for reproduction modes of rosette colonies.
The folder organisation is similar to the above.


# Costly fragmentation

Contains the code and data for reproduction modes under costly fragmentation.
The folder organisation is similar to the above.
